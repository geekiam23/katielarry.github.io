            <li>1. Sharing content can be confusing and take too long.</li>
            <li>2. Organizing content can be difficult with numerous files.</li>
            <li>3. Many cloud storage applications don’t have content creation as an option but users want the options to create projects for professional and personal use and save them to their cloud storage applications.)</li>
            <li>4. Uploading Images/videos can either take too long or the process isn’t intuitive.</li>
          </ol>
          <h3>SOLUTIONS</h3>
          <ol class="num-list">
            <li>1. Sharing Content: Make it as intuitive as possible by right clicking on files to share.</li>
            <li>2. Organizing content: Use categories to easily organize files, folders, and links.</li>
            <li>3. Create Content/Collaborate: Provide a seamless way to create content and save in application.</li>
            <li>4. Uploading large and small files: Make the uploading proess quick and easy by using a drag and drop feature and creating the platform so that it can withstand uploading large files.</li>

              <p class="caseStudy-text">After performing user research, I found the best way to differentiate a new cloud storage platform from the rest was to create an application where someone could perform all of their productivity needs in one spot. These productivity features included: store files, create documents, communicate, collaborate, and manage projects.</p>
              <p class="caseStudy-text">Audience: Focusing on teachers, families, students, those in the workplace.</p>
              <p class="caseStudy-text">This lead to the name, OnePlace with the slogan, “Simplify your life by going to OnePlace for everything.”</p>
              <p class="caseStudy-text">The branding design was inspired by three words: minimalist, sohpisticated, and organized.</p>

            <ol class="num-list">
              <li>1. Preference Testing</li>
              <li>2. Usability Testing with High Fidelity Mockups</li>
            </ol>

            <h3>PREFERENCE TESTING</h3>
            <p class="caseStudy-text">I performed three preference tests on the design. Two were focused on using stock images or actual images of the product on the website. One was focused on using Google’s branding colors on the Sign Up portion of the site.</p>
            <p class="caseStudy-text">After gathering the data, it was clear the users:</p>
            <ol class="num-list">
              <li>1. wanted to see images of the actual product on the site rather than stock images.</li>
              <li>2. opted for the color scheme to stay the same (gold) on the Sign Up page instead of changing Google’s name to light blue.</li>
              <li>3. recommended I add Google’s logo so it went with branding better.</li>
            </ol>

            <h3>USABILITY TESTING WITH HIGH FIDELITY MOCKUPS </h3>
            <p class="caseStudy-text">High Fidelity Mockup User Testing Feedback:</p>
            <p class="caseStudy-text">I completed three usability tests and the notes were very insightful.</p>
            <p class="caseStudy-text">The five tasks were: (1) Sign Up, (2) Login, (3) Create New Document, (4) Upload Image, (5) Share a File.</p>
            <p class="caseStudy-text">User Feedback:</p>
            <p class="caseStudy-text">The first user was able to click through each task with ease and mentioned that that it was clear.</p>
            <p class="caseStudy-text">The second user got stumped on a few things and gave feedback on five separate areas of the design. The main issues she kept running into were unrecognizable icons. She wanted more clarity on what each icon meant.</p>
            <p class="caseStudy-text">The third user specifically got stumped on a the “Create New Document” task because the button wasn’t clear. The second one the user got stumped on was the “Sharing a File” task because the share icon didn’t appear to exist to them. I will need to expand it and make it more clear.</p>
            <p class="caseStudy-text">I made the changes in mockups to reflect the feedback given.</p>

          <h3>PHASE 5: CONCLUSION</h3>
          <p class="caseStudy-text">Once all the testing and designing was completed, I ended up with a product that was clear, intuitive, and straightforward. The feedback given by each user was invaluable through the process and because of all the insight given, I was able to complete the goal I was trying to achieve.</p>
          <p class="caseStudy-text">The main learning curve I had was making sure each icon was clear to the users. I kept using icons without words next to them which created confusion for my users when trying to complete different tasks. When I added verbiage to the icons, the users were able to breeze through the tasks without extra assistance.</p>
          <p class="caseStudy-text">My takeaways from this project consisted of two things: (1) Just because something is clear to me, doesn’t mean it’s clear to everyone (icon example). (2) The product’s design only matters if the user is able to easily navigate the page. Otherwise, it’s just a pretty design that frustrates users.</p>
